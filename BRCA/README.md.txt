I downloaded the *BRCA1_NCBI_Nucleotide.fasta* and *BRCA2_NCBI_Nucleotide.fasta* sequences using the query "(BRCA1[Gene Name]) AND Homo Sapiens[Organism]" (or "(BRCA2[Gene Name]) AND Homo Sapiens[Organism]")

I downloaded the *BRCA1_NCBI_Gene-Other_seq.fa.fa* and *BRCA1_NCBI_Gene-Other_seq.fa* sequences by downloaded each sequence manually and combining them.  These are the "mRNA" sequences in the "Related sequences" section on NCBI Gene (for [BRCA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/672) and [BRCA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/675), respectively)

I think this will largely be updated with future analysis
