To be fair, I am starting with a [negative bias](https://twitter.com/cwarden45/status/1134864619552378880).  However, I will be very happy if I can convince people that the companies / organizations need to *i)* share your raw data with you, *ii)* share all the details for coming to their conclusions, and *iii)* have some way of publically sharing trends in their own data, with fair representations in limitations in confidence.  

In other words, that is a little different than the results being inaccurate, which is harder to show (and I have to be mindful of my prior expectations, since that can cause me to be overly harsh).

EverlyWell (Helix for DNA Sequencing):
-----------------

There were 3 "Genomics Tests" tests on the EverlyWell website.  I ordered two of them (the **Food Sensitivity Test+** and **Metabolism Test+**).

While I will describe the results when I get them, I did want to mention one thing before I forget:

The "*Food Sensitivity*" test is a blood test (testing for **IgG reactivity**).  While I was initially confused because I had a saliva collection tube for the "*Metabolism Test*" but not the "Food Sensitivity" test (and that saliva collection tube was *not* an OrageneDx spit kit - it was just had a generic conical tube with some barcode stickers on it), **I think this is because I already have my Exome sequenced from Helix**.

Also, the saliva collection kit for the Metabolism Test is being used for something other than DNA sequencing?  To be clear, I'm not saying that the generic conical tube is bad.  However, I am saying the work needs to be done at the appropriate pace, so that I have reasonable expectations of what I will recieve.  If I see one thing on-line and I get something else delivered, that causes me some amount of concern. 

For example, what I recieved does match the [EverlyWell Food Sensitivity Test](https://www.everlywell.com/products/food-sensitivity/).  I'm still a little confused about [a product picture](https://dxkmbl8uwuv9p.cloudfront.net/myhelix/1556831649426/562cb0c0-de4d-43d8-944b-98ebbf3adf78/FS_WhatYoullGet_Img.png) on the Helix website (which actually matches what I saw, without a "Saliva Collection Tube" in the listing of kit materials).  However, I was initially sufficiently concerned that I posted a reply to the Twitter discussion thread.  **Accordingly, I promptly deleted that as soon as I saw this alternative explanation.**  While this still leaves me some concerns, they are not as urgent as I intially thought.  ***So, I apologize if anybody saw that response in the brief time that it was posted.***

Also, as a matter of personal preference, I like getting my blood drawn by somebody else (you can't look away when you are using a lancet on yourself, and I got light-headed the one / first time that I donated a large amount of blood).  However, I realize that people with diabetes unfortunately have to do something similar every day (although I thought the volume of blood was less: I have to wait to produce enough blood for 5 large spots for each of these tests).
