To be fair, I am starting with a [negative bias](https://twitter.com/cwarden45/status/1134864619552378880).  However, if I show the difficulty in assessing the claims, that is probably even more important than showing the claims are incorrect (since I think the most important point is that the companies / organizations need to share your data, share all the details for coming to their conclusions, and have some way of publically sharing trends in their own data, with fair representations in limitations in confidence.

EverlyWell:
-----------------

There were 3 "Genomics Tests" tests on the EverlyWell website.  I ordered two of them.

While I will describe the results when I get them, I did want to mention one thing before I forget:

The "**Food Sensitivity**" test is just a blood test (testing for **IgG reactivity**).  So, I'll double-check if I can get raw DNA data, but I don't think that part is accurate (I think they just test reactivity of your protein from the blood test).

Unlike the "Metabolism+ Test" there isn't even a spit kit.

In other words, is is what the materials look like for the Food Sensitivity test:

But this picture is also on [the Food Sensitvity+ Test website](https://www.helix.com/products/everlywell-food-sensitivity?utm_source=EverlyWell_sitelink_PIP_FSPluscart), and that is **not** accurate:

**So, please note that there is no spit kit for the Food Sensitivity (and it looks like *they no longer use the OrageneDx spit kit for Metabolism+ Test* - I just had a generic conical tube with some barcode stickers on it).**

Also, as a matter of personal preference, I like getting my blood drawn by somebody else (you can't look away when you are using a lancet on yourself).  However, that may just be me :)

GenoPalate:

Uploaded 23andMe data at same time as AncestryDNA data.

"SNP not detected" doesn't explain all differences:

Carbohydrates:
23andMe: ZBED3 --> AA - 64.9% --> Your Recommendation: High Fiber
AncestryDNA: [ZBED3 missing]

Carbohydrates:
23andMe: [NOTCH2 missing]
AncestryDNA: NOTCH2 --> GG - 67.3%--> Your Recommendation: High Fiber

Fats (**Inconsistent**):
23andMe: ADIPOQ --> AG - 4.5% --> Your Recommendation: High Monounsaturated Fatty Acids
AncestryDNA: ADIPOQ --> AG - 46.5% --> Your Recommendation: Moderate Monounsaturated Fatty
Acids

When asked how to determine details for risk assessment (such as SNP IDs, primary literature citations / databases, etc.), I was told *[we] are not able to share with you specific studies and SNP's that we review because we keep our scientific process private*".

So, I currently believe that you should not purchase a kit from this company.
