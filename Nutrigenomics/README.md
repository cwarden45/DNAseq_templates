To be fair, I am starting with a [negative bias](https://twitter.com/cwarden45/status/1134864619552378880).  However, I will be very happy if I can convience people that the companies / organizations need to *i)* share your raw data with you, *ii)* share all the details for coming to their conclusions, and *iii)* have some way of publically sharing trends in their own data, with fair representations in limitations in confidence.  

In other words, that is a little different than the results being inaccurate, which is harder to show (and I have to be mindful of my prior expectations, since that can cause me to be overly harsh).

EverlyWell:
-----------------

There were 3 "Genomics Tests" tests on the EverlyWell website.  I ordered two of them.

While I will describe the results when I get them, I did want to mention one thing before I forget:

The "**Food Sensitivity**" test is just a blood test (testing for **IgG reactivity**).  So, I'll double-check if I can get raw DNA data, but I don't think that part is accurate (I think they just test reactivity of your protein from the blood test).

**Unlike the "Metabolism+ Test," *there isn't even a spit kit for the "Food Sensitivity" test*.**

In other words, is is what the materials look like for the Food Sensitivity test:

But this picture is also on [the Food Sensitvity+ Test website](https://www.helix.com/products/everlywell-food-sensitivity?utm_source=EverlyWell_sitelink_PIP_FSPluscart), and that is **not** accurate:

**So, please note that there is no spit kit for the Food Sensitivity (and it looks like *they no longer use the OrageneDx spit kit for Metabolism+ Test* - I just had a generic conical tube with some barcode stickers on it).**

I think part of the confusion may be that I was ordering this kit through Helix, since they already have DNA for me.  For example, what I recieved does match the [EverlyWell Food Sensitivity Test](https://www.everlywell.com/products/food-sensitivity/).  I'm still a little confused about that screenshot on the Helix website (which actually matches what I saw, without a "Saliva Collection Tube" in the listing of kit materials).  However, I was initially sufficiently concerned that I posted a reply to the Twitter discussion thread.  However, I proptly deleted that as soon as I saw this alternative explanation.  While this still leaves me some concerns, they are not as urgent as I intially thought.  So, I apologize if anybody saw that response in the brief time that it was posted.

Also, as a matter of personal preference, I like getting my blood drawn by somebody else (you can't look away when you are using a lancet on yourself).  However, that may just be me :)

Uploaded 23andMe data at same time as AncestryDNA data.

"SNP not detected" doesn't explain all differences:

*Carbohydrates*:
23andMe: ZBED3 --> AA - 64.9% --> Your Recommendation: High Fiber

AncestryDNA: [ZBED3 missing]

*Carbohydrates*:

AncestryDNA: NOTCH2 --> GG - 67.3%--> Your Recommendation: High Fiber

*Fats* (**Inconsistent**):
