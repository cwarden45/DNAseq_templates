To be fair, I am starting with a [negative bias](https://twitter.com/cwarden45/status/1134864619552378880).  However, if I show the difficulty in assessing the claims, that is probably even more important than showing the claims are incorrect (since I think the most important point is that the companies / organizations need to share your data, share all the details for coming to their conclusions, and have some way of publically sharing trends in their own data, with fair representations in limitations in confidence.

When asked how to determine details for risk assessment (such as SNP IDs, primary literature citations / databases, etc.), I was told *[we] are not able to share with you specific studies and SNP's that we review because we keep our scientific process private*".

So, I currently believe that you should not purchase a kit from this company.
