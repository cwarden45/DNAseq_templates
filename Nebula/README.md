Because I believe most people are recieving low-coverage sequencing from [basepaws](https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome) for $95 (while I ordered ~15x sequencing for $1000), I thought it might be good to have plots similar to sections of that repository.

For example, here are the FastQC Plots (similar to the [Read_QC](https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome/blob/master/Basepaws_Notes/Read_QC/README.md) section):

![R1 adapter content](FastQC_adapter_content_R1.png "R1 adapter content")

![R2 adapter content](FastQC_adapter_content_R2.png "R2 adapter content")

The plots above show that the insert size is probably larger for my Nebula dataset than Bastu's basepaws dataset (since I see fewer adapters in teh sequences).
