I think most people get reports with sequencing performed by Dante Labs.  However, I tested uploading different files using [this link](https://us.dantelabs.com/products/import-your-genetic-data).

More specifically, I tested uploading the following files for at least 1 of the 3 available reports:

 - **23andMe** ("*Nutrigenomics & Lifestyle*", "*Fitness*", and "*Wellness & Lifestyle*")
 - **AncestryDNA** ("*Nutrigenomics & Lifestyle*", "*Fitness*", and "*Wellness & Lifestyle*")
 - **BWA-MEM + GATK Re-Aligned Veritas WGS .vcf** ("*Nutrigenomics & Lifestyle*")
 
 Even with the discount of $4.99 instead of $49.99, I decided not to further test other .vcf files (even though I could have done so for other data types, such as my Genos Exome VCF, my Helix Exome+ gVCF from Mayo GeneGuide, my Nebula imputed gVCF, etc.).
 
 Uploading a .vcf cost $19.99 instead of $4.99, so that is why I only generated one type of report for that.
 
 In order to avoid paying twice (to test the effect of .vcf formating), I uploaded the GATK .vcf from a re-alignment with BWA-MEM froma the Veritas FASTQ files.  The freebayes indel formatting is a little different, and I wanted to avoid a difference that could be due to a formatting issue.
 
 Also, I got an error message if I tried to upload an compressed .vcf file (or my .gVCF file).  ***So, that makes me concerned that the upload may not actually be compatible for large gVCF files.***
 
 I purchased this after my other [Nutrigenomics Tests](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Nutrigenomics).  However, the other 2 reports are fairly different.  For most people, I think they would probably be most intersted in the ***Wellness & Lifestyle*** (which includes disease risk), although the results matched what I had seen from other companies (in terms of where I was supposed to be at higher risk) and this is most similar to what 23andMe had to temporarily remove while the results were checked by the FDA.
 
 Out of the 3 reports, only the "Wellness & Lifestyle" reported anything dante labs considered to be at high risk:
 
  - **Factor V Leiden thrombophilia** ([rs6025](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs6025); [F5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2153); *chr1:169519049*) - also in my [23andMe and Color reports](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Color).  I would consider it lower risk than some other pathogenic variants, but it is in [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000000674.4/)
  - **Age-related macular degeneration** ([rs10490924](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs10490924); [ARMS2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/387715); chr10:124214448) - this is the same variant as my [23andMe report](https://you.23andme.com/reports/ghr.amd/) which says "*Variant detected, **not** likely at increased risk*".  There are some ClinVar entries, but the links from dbSNP say [both "Risk-Factor" and "Likely-Benign"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs10490924#clinical_significance)
  
 **So, I am not actually suggesting others purchase any of these reports, if they already have a 23andMe or similar report.**  In general, my opinion is that this is either the type of re-analysis that would be provided for free, or where the evidence and or level of risk may or may not be high.
 
 I was also a little concerned that the link to upload my "Wellness & Lifestyle" 23andMe data actually said "AncestryDNA: Fitness (Kit ID: TPD16382842155959)" as well as "Upload Your Genetic Data from 23andMe".  However, the report I recieved was in fact different than the other reports (so, I would consider this a minor typo.)
