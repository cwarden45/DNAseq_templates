Personal Thoughts
-----------------

***My regional ancestry is mostly European***: 42% England / Wales / Northwestern Europe, 22% Germanic Europe, 21% Ireland & Scotland, 8% Norway, 3% Sweden, 2% Benin/Togo, 2% Ivory Coast / Ghana, and 1% European Jewish.

My maternal (relatively) recent ancestry is from Arkanasas (near Memphis) and Tennessee, so the "Additional Community" result of "Northern Arkansas & Middle Tennessee Settlers" was interesting.  However, I think this would be more useful as a sort of free analysis for exported raw data (rather than purchasing another chip).

I also found some additional family members that had AncestryDNA data, but not 23andMe data.  However, I think recommending people deposit their data into public databases to search for family members is preferable than having everybody purchase both 23andMe and AncestryDNA tests to search both sets of customers for family members.  

I also ordered the version of AncestryDNA that provides some trait information, and I filled out the questions for the "Personal Discoveries Project."  The Traits results are a little hard to view all at once, but I think providing the regional ancestry variation for each trait was interesting.

I uploaded my AncestryDNA data and reports to [my PGP page](https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu832966), if anybody wants to look into those.

***So, overall, I wouldn't push too hard for people to have an additional test (and I'm not purchasing the additional Ancestry membership), but I think it provides some potentially interesting information.  For an extra $10, I think the extra traits results are worth it.***

Raw Data File Conversion
-----------

I actually had an earlier [blog post](http://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2013/12/additional-analysis-of-ancestrydna-data.html) where I did some file conversion and analysis for somebody else.  So, that was one less thing that I had to write for my own data!

Just in case there have been some more recent chip changes, I created a new Venn Diagram with my own data, and (similar to my [Genes for Good](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Genes_for_Good) data) I tested making HLA Predictions below.

-----------

### For Research Purposes Only! ###

I had the V3 23andMe chip for my sample.  My AncestryDNA chip had 667,884 probes.

Below, my HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C results are robust with the different genotyping and sequencing technologies, but my HLA-D type assignments change.
