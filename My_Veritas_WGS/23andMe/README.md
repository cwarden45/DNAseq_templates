Please see this [blog post](http://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2012/06/my-23andme-results-getting-free-second.html) to learn more about the Perl scripts

**Perl Script Notes**
- hg19 is no longer the latest reference sequence, but it is what was used for my WGS sample and you can get hg19 annotationsfrom SeattleSeq here: http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation138/
- SeattleSNP didn't recognize some alleles from 23andMe (mostly deletions)

**New Scripts**
- **23andMe_to_VCF.py** - converts 23andMe raw format to VCF (`python 23andMe_to_VCF.py --input=[23andMe file]`, if you've run the Vertias WGS scripts.  Type `python 23andMe_to_VCF.py --help` for more information)

â‹…You'll want to check the 23andMe data portal for variants with "D" or "I" annotations, since you  may consider your actual genotype is counter-intuitive.  So, unless you happen to have the same genotype as me, you may have to modify the python code (and possibly add insertion sequences from [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp)).  More specifically, I skip "DD" and "II" genotypes (since they usually match the reference), and I'll write a separate script to check for indels called from WGS data with rsID from 23andMe chip.  So, that should cut down on the code that needs to be modified (and deleterious indels are probably more likely to be heterozygous anyways).
