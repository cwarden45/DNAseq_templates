NOTE:
- hg19 is no longer the latest reference sequence, but it is what was used for my WGS sample and you can get hg19 annotationsfrom SeattleSeq here: http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation138/
- SeattleSNP didn't recognize some alleles from 23andMe (mostly deletions), so I am using the original 23andMe raw data file to compare to my WGS variants
