Start by using scripts in [My_Veritas_WGS](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/edit/master/My_Veritas_WGS) and/or [Exome_Workflow](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/tree/master/Exome_Workflow)

The Genos website says that they used an [Agilent SureSelect Commercial](https://genos.co/sequencing.html) kit.  This is a commonly used platform, and kit information can be downloaded from [SureDesign](https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/).  However, you are supposed to register using a work e-mail (a personal G-mail account won't work), and there multiple types and versions of SureSelect kits.  So, as an approximation, I downloaded exon .bed files from the [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/), testing different flanking lengths for coverage approximations.
