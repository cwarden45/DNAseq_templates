### For Research Purposes Only! ###

The Genos website says that they used an [Agilent SureSelect Commercial](https://genos.co/sequencing.html) kit.  This is a commonly used platform, and kit information can be downloaded from [SureDesign](https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/).  However, you are supposed to register using a work e-mail (a personal G-mail account won't work), and there multiple types and versions of SureSelect kits.  So, as an approximation, I downloaded exon .bed files from the [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/), testing different flanking lengths for coverage approximations.

**Download hg19 Exon Locations in .bed Format**

*Step #1*) Go to the [UCSC Table Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables)

*Step #2*) Make sure clade is "Mammal", genome is "human", and assembly is "Feb 2009 (GRCh37/hg19)"

*Step #3*) Select the type of gene annotation.  So, group should be "Genes and Gene Predictions" and the type of gene annotation is listed under the track pull-down.  I tested "RefSeq", "UCSC", and "GENCODE Genes V19".

*Step #4*) Make sure region is set to "genome"

*Step #5*) Select .bed output format

*Step #6*) Provide an output file name for "output file".  For example "RefSeq_genes_0bp_flanking.bed"

*Step #7*) Click "get output"

*Step #8*) On the next screen, select the radio button for the desired regions.

You can try "Exons Plus [n] bases at each end" (where the default setting of n is 0), but based upon visualization of the GAPDH gene, it looks like only CDS regions were covered.  So, the best representative coverage statistic will likely come from regions defined with "Coding Exons" (which I test in a table below).

*Step #9*) Click "get BED" to download your file

**Download Karyotype-Ordered Reference**

Please note that reference should be karyotpe-ordered (starting with chrM), to match provided alignment reference (or if using GATK functions on a new alignment from the .fasta files).

If you've already run the Veritas WGS scripts, the karyotype reference does not contain supplemental chromosomes because the raw data was separate chromosome alignments for the primary chromosomes (and re-alignment scripts use reads extracted from a combined .bam file, which won't contain unaligned reads).  So, a different karyotype-sorted reference would still need to be created.

Currently, you can download such a file from ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/hg19/

If the link above doesn't work, you can [click here](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/bundle), click the link under "FTP Server Access", and then click on the "hg19" subfolder.  You can decompress the reference using `gunzip` in the Docker image or [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) on Windows.

**Convert .bed File to .target_intervals for Picard**

I use [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) for file-conversion and coverage statisics (and some down-stream steps).  You can download all the programs separately, but I'm providing instruction assuming that you are using my [dnaseq-dependencies](https://hub.docker.com/r/cwarden45/dnaseq-dependencies/) Docker image.  Please see the main  [My_Veritas_WGS](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/edit/master/My_Veritas_WGS) README with some additional information about setting up Docker.

*Step #1*) If you have not done so already, you'll need to have downloaded a copy of the hg19 reference genome in FASTA format.  Please see the main  [My_Veritas_WGS](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/edit/master/My_Veritas_WGS) README with some additional information about setting up Docker.

*Step #2*) If you have downloaded the appropriate .bed file, you can create the interval list (which also creates the .dict file for the refernece, if it doesn't already exist) by running `python create_interval_file.py --input=targets.bed --ouput=targets.interval_list --ref=hg19.fa`.  If running the script within the downloaded folder, after the Veritas WGS scripts, the RefSeq gene interval list would be created with the command `python create_interval_file.py --input=RefSeq_genes_CDS.bed --output=RefSeq_genes_CDS.interval_list --ref=hg19.karyotype.fasta`

You can type `python create_interval_file.py --help` for more information.

**Coverage Metrics for Provided .bam Alignment File**

If you've created the appropriate .interval_list file, you can calculate coverage statistics by running `python calculate_coverage_statistics.py --alignment=sample.bam --intervals=targets.interval_list --ref=hg19.fa`.  If running the script within the downloaded folder, after the Veritas WGS scripts, the RefSeq gene interval list would be created with the command `python calculate_coverage_statistics.py --alignment=[sampleID].mapped.sorted.markdup.realn.recal --intervals=RefSeq_genes_CDS.interval_list --ref=ucsc.hg19.fasta`.  By default, the prefix for the output is the concatination of the name for the .bam file and the .interval_list file, but this can be manually specified using `--output_prefix=prefix`.

| Annotation | Flanking | Avg Cov | Percent 10x | Percent 20x |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|RefSeq CDS|0 bp|126.8x|88.1%|84.7%|
|RefSeq Exon|0 bp|59.1x|43.0%|40.7%|
|UCSC CDS|0 bp|---|---|---|
|UCSC Exon|0 bp|---|---|---|
|GENCODE CDS|0 bp|---|---|---|
|GENCODE Exon|0 bp|---|---|---|

*CDS = Coding exons

*Average coverage (Avg Cov) = MEAN_TARGET_COVERAGE

*Percent 10x = PCT_TARGET_BASES_10X

*Percent 20x = PCT_TARGET_BASES_20X

**Re-Align Reads and Re-Call Variants**

**Filter Off-Target Variants**

In general, shouldn't really matter for non-synonymous mutations in known genes, but you might want restrict non-coding regulatory variants within target regions.  In this case, enrichment is for CDS regions, but you can still test the effect of filtering different mutation calling strategies and/or checking how the regions for your annotation program of choice compares to covered regions (here, gene CDS boundaries from the UCSC genome browser).

### Other Notes ###

Unless specified differently above, I used scripts / strategies described in the main  [My_Veritas_WGS](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/edit/master/My_Veritas_WGS) page.
