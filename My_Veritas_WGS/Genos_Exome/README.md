### For Research Purposes Only! ###

The Genos website says that they used an [Agilent SureSelect Commercial](https://genos.co/sequencing.html) kit.  This is a commonly used platform, and kit information can be downloaded from [SureDesign](https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/).  However, you are supposed to register using a work e-mail (a personal G-mail account won't work), and there multiple types and versions of SureSelect kits.  So, as an approximation, I downloaded exon .bed files from the [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/), testing different flanking lengths for coverage approximations.

**Download hg19 Exon Locations in .bed Format**

*Step #1*) Go to the [UCSC Table Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables)

*Step #2*) Make sure clade is "Mammal", genome is "human", and assembly is "Feb 2009 (GRCh37/hg19)"

*Step #3*) Select the type of gene annotation.  So, group should be "Genes and Gene Predictions" and the type of gene annotation is listed under the track pull-down.  I tested "RefSeq", "UCSC", and "GENCODE Genes V19".

*Step #4*) Make sure region is set to "genome"

*Step #5*) Select .bed output format

*Step #6*) Provide an output file name for "output file".  For example "RefSeq_genes_0bp_flanking.bed"

*Step #7*) Click "get output"

*Step #8*) On the next screen, select the radio button for "Exons Plus [n] bases at each end" (where the default setting of n is 0)

*Step #9*) Click "get BED" to download your file

**Convert .bed File to .target_intervals for Picard**

I use [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) for file-conversion and coverage statisics (and some down-stream steps).  You can download all the programs separately, but I'm providing instruction assuming that you are using my [dnaseq-dependencies](https://hub.docker.com/r/cwarden45/dnaseq-dependencies/) Docker image.  Please see the main  [My_Veritas_WGS](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/edit/master/My_Veritas_WGS) README with some additional information about setting up Docker.

*Step #1*) If you have not done so already, you'll need to have downloaded a copy of the hg19 reference genome in FASTA format.  Please see the main  [My_Veritas_WGS](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/edit/master/My_Veritas_WGS) README with some additional information about setting up Docker.

*Step #2*) If you have downloaded the appropriate .bed file, you can create the interval list (which also creates the .dict file for the refernece, if it doesn't already exist) by running `python coverage_statistics.py --input=targets.bed --ouput=targets.interval_list --ref=hg19.fa`.  If running the script within the downloaded folder, after the Veritas WGS scripts, the RefSeq gene interval list would be created with the command `python coverage_statistics.py --input=RefSeq_genes_0bp_flanking.bed --ouput=../RefSeq_genes_0bp_flanking.interval_list --ref=hg19.fasta`

You can type `python coverage_statistics.py --help` for more information.

**Coverage Metrics for Provided .bam Alignment File**

| Annotation | Flanking | Avg Cov | Percent 10x | Percent 20x |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|RefSeq|0 bp||||
|RefSeq|200 bp|---|---|---|
|UCSC|0 bp|---|---|---|
|UCSC|200 bp|---|---|---|
|GENCODE|0 bp|---|---|---|
|GENCODE|200 bp|---|---|---|

**Re-Align Reads and Re-Call Variants**

**Filter Off-Target Variants**

Shouldn't really matter for non-synonymous mutations in known genes, but you'll probably want non-coding regulatory variants within target regions. 

### Other Notes ###

Unless specified differently above, I used scripts / strategies described in the main  [My_Veritas_WGS](https://github.com/cwarden45/DNAseq_templates/edit/master/My_Veritas_WGS) page.
