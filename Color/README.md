I purchased a kit from Color because I really liked their [public portal](https://data.color.com/) to browse variant information.

While the return of data was not automated, I was allowed to fill out a HIPPA authorization form for Protected Health Information (PHI), which included a box to check for "Raw Genetic Data."  Once I get that, I will upload it to my [Personal Genome Project page](https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu832966).

Some reports are also up there, but I also encounted some issues uploading PDF files recently.  So, I decided to go ahead and post all of that information here.

I also though the following notes from the ordering physican were interesting:

- Some of the medications you shared you are taking (indomethacin and citalopram) may have an increased risk of an interaction. Please do not make any changes to your medications before speaking to your provider. The benefits of taking these interacting medications at the same time can often outweigh the risks and stopping a medication suddenly could be harmful. We recommend you speak with the healthcare provider who prescribed these medications to discuss if they are working as intended.
- Some of the medications you shared you are taking (citalopram) may impact how your body processes medications. Taking these medications at the same time may lead to a different response to the medications than the genetic results suggest. Please do not make any changes to your medications before speaking to your provider. The benefits of taking these interacting medications at the same time can often outweigh the risks, and stopping a medication suddenly could be harmful. We recommend you speak with the healthcare provider who prescribed these medications to discuss if they are working as intended.

I'm not sure if these were manually entered.  However, if it is possible to learn more about the primary evidence for those notes (even though they don't involve any genetic information).

The "Medication Response" results also allow you to schedule an appointment with a clinical pharmacist at no additional cost.  So, I will also check that out and post some notes here.
